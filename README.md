**Assignment:**
Download and install PostgreSQL on your devices (for Mac users I recommend the app)

- Using Figma/Lucidchart, create an ER Diagram of your database
- Create a brand new database with a specific topic (eg pizza, students, employees, etc.) with 
  -At least four different tables.
  -Each table should have a primary key
  -Each table should have at least four dummy tuples
  -Each table should be able to be joined with one other table in the database (this will make sense once you understand schemas)
-Write an inner join query that joins two tables, one that joins three tables and one that joins all four tables (you can stack inner joins)
-Finally using Postman, try to post a brand new line of data and get two different lines of dummy data that you placed inside the database. Take a screenshot of your work on   Postman and put it inside of your repo.
You can do this by either setting up Express routes to hit (recommended) or straight through the database using xmysql package
